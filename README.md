This is a demo how my nodejs application template is built. 

The ready to use template is at https://github.com/tlan16/node-typescript-application-template. 

# Node.js library template

It uses:

1. EcmaScript Modules (ESM)
2. Native file watcher for dev server. No need for nodemon.
3. Native .env file handler. No need for dotenv.
6. pnpm and corepack for package management.
9. ESM named export mocking with vitest.
